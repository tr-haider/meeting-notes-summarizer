Good afternoon Haider! How can I help you?

Good afternoon, Doctor. I’ve been having terrible sneezing fits and itchy eyes for the past few weeks.

That sounds uncomfortable. Do you notice these symptoms more at certain times or places?
Yes, it’s worse when I’m outside or near plants.

It sounds like you might be experiencing seasonal allergies. Have you tried any over-the-counter allergy medications?

I tried an antihistamine, but it only helped a little.

There are different types of antihistamines, and sometimes it takes trying a few to see which one works best for you. I can also prescribe a nasal spray that might help with your symptoms. Additionally, staying indoors on high pollen days and using air filters can reduce your exposure to allergens.

That makes sense. I’ll try the nasal spray and be more mindful of pollen levels.

Great. Let’s follow up in a few weeks to see how you’re doing.
