Agenda
Development Updates
Completed Tasks 
* Updated Facebook SDK 
* Updated the size of scanning button 
* Updated the landing page to have the latest scanning result screen images.
* Bug fix 
   * Fixed global search issue, Now search results are retained on the back navigation
Discussion Items 
* Mapping the new Nyckel damage labels to UI/UX -- Braden has been creating new labels like "Mint with Dirt" to help the AI recognize when dirt, sharpie and other non-damage features are included and other labels between the 3 main damage categories, so some of these will need to be simply mapped to Mint/Playable/Not Playable, but others with modifiers like "Dirt" could be presented to the user to recommend that they clean their ball.  So we need to verify those new labels in Nyckel and how best to represent them in the app when the user has a data connection.
* Concept for a new scan mode button options that offers 3 buttons to choose from ID+Damage, ID Only, Damage Only.  We're imaging these like a slider or wheel the the user can use to swipe to position the scan mode button in the center to tap and launch.  This will allow users to bypass functions that they don't need.
* External API keys and documentation for a student challenge using SMGB's AI to power a golf ball sorting robot.
* Clarification is needed regarding the implementation of the damage analysis.
   * At certain points, ROP weights have been assigned identically. If we receive similar labels with the images, how will we prioritize the labels in that case?
   * For uncertain cases, what will be the application's workflow? Any suggestion?
   * We need a text on the scan result screen for new ROP types.
* Question for Braden:  
   * Has the NYCKEL API detected the ball area, or do we need to handle it ourselves?




Notes
* Discussion on the Point 1 
   * If the Nyckel API scanned dirt then show a message on the screen “Clean the ball and scan again”
* Discussion on the multiple labels
   * Pass through the users to the scanning result screen if the result confidence is low 
   * Branden will provide feedback on the final AI model when it is ready for integration 
   * Mint with dirt → Dirt is a modifier
      * It's the mint condition ball and it's dirty so show the message on UI “Clean the ball”.
   * The category will be the same but with an additional modifier
* Discussion on the damage weights  
   * Mint and Near Mint should have the same ID and say Mint 
   * Playable dirty, Playable mild scuff and Playable mild erosion should have the same ID 
   * Significant damage heavy erosion and Significant damage major scuff should have the same ID
   * 1 should say it's mint but dirty 
   * The priority of the most damaged balls is high
* Discussion on the scanning button request
   * Show a slider or wheel for selecting the scanning mode 
   * Each of these modes will have its flow for example if they select only ID then we don't need to show the damage detection screen(damage detection capture screen) 
   * Exclude damage-only mode (Ball brand and model detection is mandatory for detecting the damage)
      * The team will think about this flow if we need to detect only damage during the scanning and exclude the brand and model detection of the golf ball.
* Discussion on the Concept of External API 
   * Make internal API to call from an endpoint 
   * Create documentation and keys for external use
   * Deploy the AI model to the server and use their keys for external use
   * Features to show through the external API
      * Make
      * Model 
      * Damage
   * Single API key for One user which will be used on a single device for a certain number of calls per month 
* Discussion on the uncertain cases
   * If an uncertain case occurs tell the user sorry this feature is not available please try later and take the user to the result screen
   * If all the confidence scores are under 80% show them the highest confidence score however they are under 80% print those results.
      * Team SMGB will discuss and share the final option
* Discussion on the question posted for Braden
   * Confirmation is needed from Braden


Action items
* Share the current damage messages with the Team SMGB
* Team SMGB will share the text for the rest of the damage detection for the UI 
* Share the updated UI of the scanning screen having options.

Notes
Discussion on the Nyckel API integration

* Graham: we will not ask the people for the playing condition of the ball, Nyckel API will detect the damage of the ball.
* Pick only the worst damage image for damage detection
* Tim: If damage is all side of the ball then we will call it as significant damage
Discussion on the JOTD notification settings (two devices)
* Use the device ID to turn off the JOTD 
* Bahadar explains a corner case (If a user turns off the notification and deletes the application)
   * Graham Shares another scenario where the User logs out from the application and signs through the new ID 
   * GM explains that we should have JOTD notifications associated with the Device ID 
      * Final Conclusion: Use device ID for the JOTD notification and by default option should be On 
      * If a user uninstalls and then reinstalls the application, notifications should be enabled by default.
Discussion on task prioritization
* Need a table of name variations for the models like topflite /top flight etc 
* Optimize the search on the mobile side to add a new golf ball search.


Action items
* Provide a list of Aliases having quite similar names (topflite /topflight)

   * Version 3 is with the double arrow
   * All balls have their distinctive cover type etc.
   * Bahadar explains that we are not recognizing the arrows we have to retrain the AI model
   * We should have the image of all models in the database and serve these images instead of generic images on the recommendation screen

         * Show box and guiding lines on scanning screen for detection
